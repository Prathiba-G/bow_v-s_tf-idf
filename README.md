TF-IDF vs. Bag of Words Comparison

## Overview
This project compares two popular text representation techniques: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Words (BOW). The goal is to evaluate their effectiveness in text classification tasks.

## Techniques Used
- **Bag of Words (BOW)**: A simple representation that counts the frequency of words in a document, disregarding grammar and word order.
- **TF-IDF**: A more sophisticated representation that considers the importance of words in a document relative to the entire dataset, reducing the weight of common words.
